Description: KDE Partition Manager Core
 KDE Parition Partition Manager Core (KPM core) allows
 software to re-use common partitioning GUI tasks.
 .
 It is used in the generic system installer called Calamares
 and may be used in more interfaces in the future. Right now it
 is unlikely to be useful installed on its own.
